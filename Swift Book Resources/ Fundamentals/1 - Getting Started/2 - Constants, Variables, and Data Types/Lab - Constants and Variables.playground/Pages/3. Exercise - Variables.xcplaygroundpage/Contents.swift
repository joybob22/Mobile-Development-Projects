## Exercise - Variables
 
 Declare a variable `schooling` and set it to the number of years of school that you have completed. Print `schooling` to the console.
 */
var schooling = 14

//:  Now imagine you just completed an additional year of school, and update the `schooling` variable accordingly. Print `schooling` to the console.
schooling = 15

//:  Does the above code compile? Why is this different than trying to update a constant? Print your explanation to the console using the `print` function.
print("Yes! Normal variables are okay to change! In fact it is expected that when we declare a varibale rather than a constant that it will change at least once during the life of the program. This is not a requirement of variables though.")
